# LandMonkAPI

## About
* LandMonk is a property management software that empowers landlords to self-manage their rental homes and apartments.

## My Developer Role
* Created the database with CRUD functions using MySQL and .NET by contributing the following:
* 1. Set up the .NET Core Service Configuration in order to register different services
* 2. Created the LoggerService using NLog and in order to populate the Logging Messages 
* 3. Created Tenant Repository in order to implement functions GetAll, GetById, Create, Delete, and Update
* 4. Created the Tenant Interface in order to enforce the requirements for functions within the Tenant Repository
* 5. Set up the HTTP requests inside the Tenant Controller and created GetAll, GetById, Post, Put, and Delete methods using Postman

The front-end application is in my `MichaelKLandMonkClient` repository.
